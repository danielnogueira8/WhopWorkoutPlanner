## `env`

This module will automatically attempt to load the keys and env vars required by the whop sdk from the env.

If the env variables are not set and requested by other whop sdk components it will throw an error.

### Currently required env variables:

- `WHOP_JWK_PK`: Public key used to verify JWTs. Encoded as a JWK. This is **NOT** required. If not set, the sdk uses an internal hardcoded value.
- `WHOP_API_KEY`: API key used to access the whop api. Get this from the app developer page on whop dashboard.
- `WHOP_WEBHOOK_KEY`: API key used to verify webhook signatures. Get this from the webhooks section on the developer dashboard.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID`: APP ID of the current app. Get this from the app developer page on whop dashboard. Looks like: `app_XXXXXXXX`
